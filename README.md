# Python
This repository contains simple python codes. Feel free to update. :)

update note:
1) - The file named file_name writes the names of the files with the file extension you want in any folder you choose (including subdirectories) line by line to the bit txt file
2) - The to_do list file contains a simple to-do list applet
